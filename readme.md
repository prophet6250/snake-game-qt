# Snake Game in C++ Qt

A trivial implementation of Snake Game in Qt. 

## Dependencies
`qt5-default` and `qt-creator` with all their dependencies should be installed on your machine

## Compile
`qmake`

`make`

`./SnakeGame`

## Contribution
Fork the repository, make changes to the codebase, push it to your forked version, and submit a pull
request.

A few thing to consider:
1. Indentation using hard tabs (width 4)
2. Multi-line indentation using spaces (whatever width is required)
3. use `#pragma once` instead of `#define` header locks

This game was part of a Qt tutorial from (https://zetcode.com/gui/qt5/snake/)
